## Introduction

This repository contains a series of scripts aimed at processing DAS waterfall imagery. The workflow includes:

1. **Image Cropping**: Extracting regions of interest from raw PNG images.
2. **Feature Extraction & Anomaly Detection**: Using a moving window approach for feature extraction and applying an IsolationForest model to identify anomalies.
3. **Classification (Under Development)**: Leveraging detected anomalies from the log file to read corresponding waveform data and perform event classification with various algorithms.

## Modules

### 01_Image_Clips.py
- **Purpose**: 
  - Reads all PNG images from a designated folder.
  - Crops each image based on a pre-defined region (top, bottom, left, right).
  - Saves the cropped images as `.npz` files in a subfolder named `waterfall_npz`.
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatically creates the destination folder if it does not exist.
  - Designed to preprocess large volumes of image data for subsequent analysis.

### 02_moving_window.py
- **Purpose**:
  - Loads the cropped image data (`.npz` files) generated by `01_Image_Clips.py` and converts RGB images to grayscale.
  - Applies a moving window approach to extract features (mean, standard deviation, maximum value, Sobel gradient mean, and Laplacian variance) from the image.
  - Uses an IsolationForest model to perform anomaly detection on the extracted features.
  - Visualizes the anomaly scores as a heatmap and overlays detected anomalies on the original DAS waterfall image.
  - Logs the center coordinates (distance and time) of anomalous windows in `anomaly_points.log` for further analysis.
- **Key Features**:
  - Customizable window size and step parameters for fine-tuning the feature extraction.
  - Applies connected component labeling to filter out overly large anomaly regions.
  - Provides visual comparisons between the anomaly heatmap and the original image data.

### Classification Module (Under Development) ðŸš§
- **Objective**:
  - To read waveform data corresponding to the anomaly points recorded in `anomaly_points.log`.
  - Develop classification algorithms (using either traditional machine learning or deep learning approaches) to categorize different types of anomalous events.
- **Concept**:
  - **Feature Fusion**: Combine time-domain and frequency-domain features extracted from waveforms for improved classification accuracy.
  - **Multimodal Data Processing**: Future plans include integrating additional sensor data to perform cross-domain analysis.
  - **Modular Design**: Aims to be easily extensible for experimenting with various classification methods, working closely with the anomaly detection results from the moving window module.
  
> **Note**: The classification module is still in the development phase and is currently in the concept validation stage. Stay tuned for updates!
